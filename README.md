# Peregrine

Peregrine is a compiled programming language currently under development. Documentation is coming soon.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

## Purpose and intent

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

### Why am I creating this language?

I am creating it to have the simplicity of Python with the efficiency of C.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

### Goals

- Ease of use
- Fast
- Highly modular
- Occupies less memory
- Compiled

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

### How does it work?

You can consider it to be a superset of C which compiles to clean C. So valid C code is also valid Peregrine code (the language is named Peregrine). It will have no garbage collector because it is a system programming language but it will be very easy to use so there will be less chance of a memory leak.

## Building/compiling Peregrine

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

### Requirements to build from source

- [GCC compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [libtcc](https://bellard.org/tcc/tcc-doc.html#Libtcc)
- [V compiler](https://vlang.io)

# Compilation instructions

1. Clone this repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/Peregrine-lang/Peregrine.git`
2. Run `cd Peregrine/Peregrine`
3. To build it, run `v peregrine.v`
4. That's it. It's that simple

## Primary implementation language

It is [written in V](https://vlang.io)

## Progress

Currently we are working on the codegen and some Peregrine programs are working

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

## Example

Here is a small example for you to understand:

```py
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

The `main` function is the entry point for the program.

## Testing

The project has automatic tests which will run on pull requests and pushes to the project.  
Tests which require user input won't run but the code will still be compiled.  
If you add new functionality to the project please run the appropriate tests for it, and create tests for your functionality if possible.

#### It is recommended to only use input when absolutely necessary (example: you test the `input()` function)

This is the case because tests which require user input will only be compiled and can only be checked for syntax errors, and not issues with the functionality of the given test subject.

#### [`/Peregrine/tests/ci`](./Peregrine/tests/ci) - Tests which require no user input.

#### [`/Peregrine/tests/manual`](./Peregrine/tests/manual) - Tests which require user input and also include the tests you write for CI
